## installation:
1. first cd to the where is the Kornet-linux.sh then run the commands and then it will install - ```sudo bash Kornet-linux.sh```
2. wait and just watch
3. done you can now join a game with the website

## FAQ:
1. what do i do if .NET installation fails
- uhh idk install it manually or something theres a choice for that in the script
2. why does the script need root?
- package managers, yeah i could've made it so it only asks for root perms only when it needs to install a package but i'm too lazy to rewrite the script

## bye
